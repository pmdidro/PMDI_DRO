We provide the simulation code for the example "Synthetic dataset --- covariate shift adaptation"

Different methods are implemented

1) DRO ==> our presented MDI_DRO method

2) ERM ==> classical empirical risk minimization

3) IWERM ==> importance weighted ERM

4) Revision ==> Additional plots provided during the revision (work in progress)

See the subfolders for the methods
