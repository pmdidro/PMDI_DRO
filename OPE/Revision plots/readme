In this folder we present some new plots requrired by the reviewer. 
In particular we compare our method with two new benchmarks, the capped IWERM and with the doubly robust method.

These are preliminary simulation results, which are work in progress. 
We will beautify and edit the plots at a later stage and include it into our existing benchmarks
